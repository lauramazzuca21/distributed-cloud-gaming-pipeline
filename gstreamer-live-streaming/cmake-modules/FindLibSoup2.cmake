#
#  Don't use LibSoup2_MIN_VERSION if you want to support

#  Instead use LibSoup22_MIN_VERSION and LibSoup24_MIN_VERSION.
#
#  Set LibSoup22_MIN_VERSION to find libsoup2.2 which version is
#  greater than LibSoup22_MIN_VERSION
#
#  Set LibSoup24_MIN_VERSION to find libsoup2.4 which version is
#  greater than LibSoup24_MIN_VERSION
#
#  WARNING: It is not possible to set LibSoup22_MIN_VERSION
#  and support any version of libsoup2.4 at the same time.
#  In this situation you have to set LibSoup24_MIN_VERSION also.
#  The same applies to LibSoup24_MIN_VERSION and libsoup2.2.
